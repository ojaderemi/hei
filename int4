# Interiew with Participant #4, May 7, 2025 for HEI project. Timestamps precede each line of dialogue (13:10 = 1:10 PM)
13:10:56 Lovely. Okay, give me one second. I'm just… Okay.
# To Do: 
13:11:07 Did you have any questions on the consent form?
13:11:18 Have you sent it back to me yet or do you…
13:11:10 No, I read through it. It feels pretty good. Yeah, I think everything looks pretty standard and all the things that Yeah, I was wondering what's the best way to do that? Do you want me to fill it out, send it to you? Do you want to do it verbally? What's a good way?
13:11:27 Let's do it verbally since I have you here rather than… Yeah, give me a second. Let me pull up my verbal version.
13:11:31 Sure.
13:11:35 But… Okay.
13:11:41 Okay.
13:11:44 How do you pronounce your name so I say it correctly?
13:11:48 I'm so glad you asked. I get a lot of questions on it. So it's olugbenga.
13:11:54 Thank you so much. And how do you pronounce yours so I'm saying it correctly?
13:11:52 Olugenga. It's a beautiful name.
13:11:57 Yeah. I mean, we're in the same boat here. My name is Yanni.
13:12:01 Yanni, where is that from, technically? Very Greek. I love it.
13:12:03 It's very Greek. Yeah. How about yourself?
13:12:09 So my name is Vari Yoruba. My family is Nigerian. Yeah.
13:12:12 Oh, very cool. Yeah.
13:12:15 Yeah. So you understand my struggle of negotiating unique Okay.
13:12:19 Yeah, it's always tough. It was always tough in class.
13:12:23 Yeah, Roll call was more or less a nightmare.
13:12:25 Exactly. Yeah. I would like right when they were getting past like the, this D's because they'd always go in alphabetical order, I would just be ready for them to butcher the name.
13:12:37 I would be like, yeah, yeah, yada, yada, you got it.
13:12:36 You would brace yourself, right? Okay, lovely.
13:12:41 I'd be like, thank you.
13:12:42 Okay, so in terms of the verbal consent to participate, these are just like the questions that you'll see at the bottom of the written version that I But I'll read them out loud to you.
13:12:49 Oh, sure. Yeah, I have that pulled up. Perfect.
13:12:54 So you're free to say yes or no to any of these questions.
13:12:57 But the first one is this. Do you wish to participate in the study? Yes or no?
13:13:02 Yes.
13:13:04 Great. And these are optional. Does the researcher may use publicly available photographs, audio and video of me in scholarly presentations or other publications showing my face or hearing my voice might serve to help others understand the research.
13:13:20 I may be identifiable as part of this activity Do you consent to that? Yes or no?
13:13:25 Yes, I do. I agree to that.
13:13:27 Great. The researcher may use audio of me from the interview, what we're doing right now, and or ethnography in scholarly presentations or publications.
13:13:35 When doing so might help others understand the research. And maybe identify it both as part of this activity.
13:13:41 Is that fine, yes or no?
13:13:42 Yes, I agree.
13:13:46 Three, the researcher may contact me for a follow-up interview should they need clarity or additional information related to the original interview.
13:13:53 Yes or no.
13:13:55 Yep, absolutely. I agree.
13:13:58 Two more. We're almost there. The researcher to receive an update on the study once this project has been completed.
13:14:00 No, all good.
13:14:06 Yes, absolutely.
13:14:08 And finally… The researcher may keep my contact information in order to contact me in the future to see whether I am interested in participating in other research studies by the principal investigator.
13:14:22 Yes, I agree. I'm easy. I agree to all of it.
13:14:27 And then finally, just one more time, do you wish to participate? Yes or no?
13:14:33 Yes, I do. This is Jan Economist verbally agreeing.
13:14:35 Lovely. Thank you so much.
13:14:38 Honest. Make it easy for both of us. It's always like the way I like to do it.
13:14:42 All right. No complaints there.
13:14:49 Let me… This.
13:14:47 Yeah.
13:14:55 Okay. Give me one second.
13:14:58 Sure.
13:15:05 Okay. So my first question is my first question is How do I put this into words?
13:15:21 Sure.
13:15:12 Yeah, so I guess what do I need to know about your upbringing so family neighborhood high school Before… coming to Northwestern to understand why you came to Northwestern.
13:15:30 Yeah, I've never been asked that question. It's really interesting actually um Very cool question. Yeah, upbringing is kind of kind of a little different than, I don't know if there's a traditional upbringing per se, but I would say it's different than maybe some of the other ones you've heard where
13:15:46 I was born in Chicago, so I lived in Chicago for a few years when I was very young. And then my family was like, they were all like from America, but were Greek. So, like, they also lived in greece
13:15:57 So when I was about two years old, 2004, we moved… to Greece for about four years. And so I was raised kind of partly in Greece and then back to Chicago. So it was kind of like split, which was kind of unique as well.
13:16:11 And so I always talk about this in the sense that that dual perspective gave me this kind of wider perspective Or wider, I guess, like lens, you could say, for lack of better words, into… kind of the world as a whole because you're getting two dual um
13:16:28 Point of views as as you're being basically raised and you're going through childhood, through adolescence, even through high school so That was really unique because I was able to kind of grow up when I was a little younger in Greece up until I was about
13:16:42 About six and a half, seven. Came back to America, kind of like finished school. And then, yeah, I've kind of been here since, but I've traveled back and forth a good amount. I would say… In terms of your question about the upbringing
13:16:56 And just like kind of education, maybe even kind of early career stuff has had allowed me to land on Northwestern. Yeah, it's a few different things. I'd say it's like three main things which were kind of educational pursuits being the main one. And then I would say another one's obviously proximity to home was a really big one.
13:17:17 And then the third one being kind of diversity of both information and like individuals so I'll kind of go through each one, but basically educational pursuits was one of the largest ones because when I came back to America and I started going to school, especially
13:17:34 I would say perhaps maybe when i was going from sixth grade to seventh grade, I started to realize that college was like kind of prevalent, you know, in the in in the front seat and I could kind of see it, but it was obviously still kind of far away
13:17:47 But I would say at the end of seventh grade going to eighth grade, I started really thinking about that.
13:17:52 And that kind of came with the decision to go to high school. So initially I wanted to go to like one of those selective enrollment schools I did the exams for them and I got to like the second exam of it, but I ended up just not getting a high enough score to get placed in them.
13:18:07 What happened was I ended up going to my neighborhood school because that was kind of like if you didn't get into a selective enrollment school or your parents weren't going to like, you know, pay for you to go to private school, then you go to your neighborhood school, which is fine. And it was kind of, I think it was a big turning point as well because the entire time, the way it worked was.
13:18:25 I went to like a small private school that was like a Lutheran school when I went from like kindergarten up until eighth grade. So very small school.
13:18:37 Boom.
13:18:32 Five kids in each class. We didn't even change classrooms. It was so small that there was no, yeah, there was no, there was a bell, but the bell was to change subjects. It wasn't to like move from a classroom.
13:18:43 We basically like, and we always, we were always active, you know, APE, recess, all that stuff. But like, we didn't change classrooms from like, you know, algebra to, or I guess science to social studies or whatever it would be. You would always stay in the class. The teachers would switch.
13:18:55 Because it was such a small school. We only had a select amount of classrooms that it wouldn't make sense to do that.
13:19:01 So the biggest going through those educational pursuits as the one ideas I was saying, the biggest kind of um contrast from, I would say middle school to high school was like how large it became because I went from a school that had, you know, I had five kids in my graduating class in eighth grade up and now into almost 400 kids in my graduating class and what would soon be my, you know, my high school senior year.
13:19:23 And so going to that, a big change was having to move, having to realize that it's a bigger school and adjusting. The adjustment period between Middle school and high school, as well as high school to college was pretty Intense, I would say. I mean, it tapered off, but in those first few months, it was a bit difficult.
13:19:39 So yeah, I went to my neighborhood high school
13:19:41 Give me one context. Piece what did you move from Greece to the States because it sounded like there was some movement that you had like where in your your trajectory was that movement happening?
13:19:48 Yeah, yeah. Sure. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, absolutely. So I was two years old when I moved to Greece. So 2004.
13:19:52 Great.
13:20:08 Okay.
13:19:57 Came back in 2000 back in winter of I think December of 2007, almost 2008. So I was about like seven and uh No, sorry. About like six. And came back in 2008, basically 2007, 2008 And that's when I ended up enrolling in that private school I was telling you about. So I think that's when I went back and I was like first grade around that time.
13:20:19 And this was in Chicago. Okay.
13:20:20 Yes, yeah. Right near where I actually live right now. So the school is like a few blocks away. I live in West Rogers Park, so… local as well, which was nice. Yeah.
13:20:28 Okay. Awesome.
13:20:31 Yeah, absolutely. And let me know anything else about context that you might be wondering.
13:20:40 Oh, no, no, you're good.
13:20:37 No, I just realized I cut you off a little bit, so I'm sorry. I'm thinking about… Like, how did you How did you learn about Northwestern?
13:20:48 And what resources did you use to like give you knowledge.
13:20:48 Yeah.
13:20:52 Let me think about it this way. How did you learn about Northwestern?
13:20:56 Did you use any like human and online resources? To help you learn more?
13:21:01 Yeah.
13:21:02 And then why did you end up coming to Northwestern of all the schools you were considering?
13:21:07 Sure. Yeah. I think that last question, it's going to be one of the more drawn out ones because there was a lot of schools that I was deciding between or that I applied to more importantly.
13:21:17 Yeah, how did I hear about Northwestern? It was basically a culmination. Northwestern and UChicago both were always at the top two. You'd like I think just from an objective standpoint, if you live in Illinois and you were really thinking about college, you're like.
13:21:29 And you wanted to stay in state, I guess is the key here too. It's like UChicago Northwestern, really good schools. If you want to, you know, go do something that's like.
13:21:36 Biology, economics, research, anything that's kind of like a top hard science or Regardless, journalism, anything that's a pretty noble pursuit and that could be anything those two schools were always like, you know, those were the reach schools So I always knew about him because I had a brother. I have a brother who's
13:21:52 Four and a half years older than me. And so he was going through the process well before me. I was a lot younger.
13:21:57 So when he was applying, I was 12-ish, 13, and I didn't even know what was going on really. I was like, okay.
13:22:03 I'm not really paying attention, but I always hear Northwestern is the best school or Chicago is the best school, like all these things. So I was like, okay.
13:22:10 I want to remember these schools when I do it eventually.
13:22:15 Apply. And so kind of like noted them in my memory for lack of better words, you know, and kind of kept that footprint. And so throughout high school.
13:22:23 It's interesting because in terms of learning more about Northwestern. I had lots of either family who were working there or who had maybe like had friends that would go on there or who did MBAs at Kellogg So they would always talk about it like, yeah, it's a great school. It's always this. That was a great school, very difficult to get into. They always followed each other.
13:22:42 And it was like, and sometimes, you know, like when things like that follow each other, you could think one of two things. You're like, okay, I'm going to work my butt off to do it.
13:22:50 Or it's like, okay, this is going to be really difficult. Should I even apply?
13:22:53 I was split between those two. Throughout the beginning of high school, it was like… You know, I don't think I'm going to get in. And then near the end, I'm like, you know what?
13:23:03 Or sorry, all the way around freshman and sophomore year of high school, when I was thinking about college, I'm like, screw Northwestern. I'm not going to get in. It's too difficult.
13:23:09 And then the last two years, I was like, all right, you know what, let me give it.
13:23:12 Let me give it a shot. I guess we'll see. But I think… In terms of your question of how do I learn about it, it came from growing up brother who was already applying, people always talking about it. And then just also being so close. I literally live like 18 minutes from Evanston. So…
13:23:28 Hmm.
13:23:28 The other aspect was my dad and I would go to the movies a lot at the old theater before it was AMC, the current AMC Evanson 12. It used to be a Century Son Arts.
13:23:36 We would go there like every Friday. It was like our Friday night thing. So we go there, sometimes get Andy's custard right after, which was right where Chipotle is right now.
13:23:44 And then, you know, he would always drive by the campus and be like, oh, that's so cool. And then he would say like, oh, it's Northwestern.
13:23:50 So I always was near it. Like, you know, it was familiar. It was in the backyard kind of idea. And, um.
13:23:56 It was always something that I had in the back of my head. In terms of your second question, which I believe was what resources did you use potentially to learn more about it?
13:24:04 Kind of a mix. It was people telling me, like I said, family, friends, individuals had gone there, whether it was for You know, an MBA program, graduate program um you know psychology program, sociology programs, even like we're doing right now just like
13:24:19 A bunch of individuals I'd either spoken to, whether it was family or friends of family, they would always just speak highly of it because it's a very well-known institution and it's obviously renowned for a lot of different things.
13:24:29 I think one thing I actually vividly remember was my birthday in 2015. So that was 10 years ago and I was about 13. I was turning 13 or That's right. I think it was 2013.
13:24:40 My uncle who at the time lived in Hong Kong because he was doing international business there. So they had his family had to move out there for a few years.
13:24:49 He had come in for my birthday. And at the same time, there was also a Kellogg's convention at the global hub. And this was like when the global hub kind of was pretty new Still, I think it was like maybe a few years old
13:25:00 I'm not sure if that's accurate, but it was relatively new. And so he did a speech there.
13:25:05 Or a keynote speech and came after to the house and he was talking about it. And then he was talking about how awesome this beautiful building was. The camps are stunning.
13:25:13 All the people there are very intelligent. They ask great questions. They're people who are leaders in the industries all across the markets and sectors and You know, they're innovators and inventors. So I was like, wow, it's really cool. And again, at that point.
13:25:27 I mean, I guess this was earlier because I'm 13 years old, you know, I'm a seventh grader. I'm going to eighth grade.
13:25:33 So again. Building that aspect.
13:25:37 In terms of online resources, that didn't really come until probably sophomore year of high school when I started really thinking about college.
13:25:44 I would bookmark certain pages from universities about ones that I kind of had like a dream list and I'd be like.
13:25:51 Research section, notable professors, alumni. I would like try to keep up with the updates of like certain pages. So that was like whether it was Northwestern research or chicago Research, Wesleyan University, Michigan, all these different universities I was thinking about applying to. I would just kind of try and keep up with certain information that was going on. At that point, it was about 20
13:26:13 18 and obviously YouTube was very established. But I would say from what I remember, I really had no idea about videos for colleges.
13:26:21 Whether it was made by a student on campus who's talking about how they got in or day in the lives, or it was from the faculty showing off dorms or, you know.
13:26:31 What you can expect if you come to this university. That was something that I just, it was probably very apparent, but I just never saw.
13:26:39 Hmm.
13:26:38 I didn't really have a lot of online resources just because maybe I also didn't really know what I could be looking for.
13:26:44 It was a mix of just doing mountain research. In terms of that slowly progressed, I would say by end of junior year when I really started applying to universities and I needed to find information about them that wasn't just on the websites.
13:26:58 I found more things on whether it was YouTube or even social platforms.
13:27:03 At that point is close to 2020. So it was even more apparent for me.
13:27:08 And so at that point, I was watching, you know, Northwestern's official YouTube channel just to see like various things. It was just, it was every, basically every university. So whether it was like.
13:27:17 Northwestern and UChicago common differences made by Quimson Tide, who has that video up there.
13:27:24 Or it was, you know, the two libraries, Chicago versus Northwestern. There was a bunch of like comparison videos.
13:27:30 And you could tell these two universities were pretty like back and forth for me.
13:27:33 And there's a caveat to this, which was UChicago is actually my number one choice for a long time.
13:27:40 The push and pull between the two is very interesting. But that'll kind of, it'll kind of just fold into what I'm molding here. I guess like the TLDR of just how I the online resources was it was mostly word of mouth from people I knew. And then by the tail end of when I started applying at the end of junior year summer into senior year fall of high school.
13:28:01 2019 of fall 2019, that's when I started kind of getting acclimated to more videos.
13:28:07 But it wasn't always Northwestern videos. Like I said, it was a lot of university things. And that's also when I kind of started discovering someone like Elliot Choi.
13:28:15 Nicholas Che, his brother, a lot of… John Fish, like a lot of influencers, you know, kind of the term you've used higher education influencers, people who went to these universities, Harvard, Princeton, Vanderbilt.
13:28:32 Brown, all these universities and they would document how they got in. And it was the first time I saw a different perspective that wasn't being told from a faculty person.
13:28:41 Or that wasn't being told in a very professional style. It was like kind of run and gun.
13:28:46 Follow me along the day. Picks up a camera or an iPhone, just like, that's it. It's like super minimalistic and it felt more genuine, which it is, I think, like when you really break it down.
13:28:55 There's a professional setup, there's narrative, there's documentary, but there's also just like more slow living kind of follow me along the day. And I really resonated with that because I hadn't seen it before.
13:29:07 So that's to your second question. Those were the kind of the resources.
13:29:11 Your third question was, how did I decide on Northwestern? Is that correct?
13:29:16 Mm-hmm.
13:29:16 Yeah, that's a very good question too. Throughout the process of senior year of high school, fall 2019 into COVID, which was obviously we're going into a point that no one saw coming.
13:29:29 I was applying every single day. And the interesting thing was since I was a CPS student.
13:29:34 October of 2019. For about, I would say, two and a half weeks Yeah, I believe two and a half weeks in October of 2019, we had a CPS strike for the t-shirt union and it was massive. It was like the longest one ever that I've ever been a student for. And so that was a…
13:29:51 It's funny because it was sucked because we were out of school. And so we're going to have to make that up at the end of the year. Obviously, that didn't happen because of COVID. So I guess it didn't suck. But at the same difficult because you
13:30:04 You kind of like it was weird Thinking about in hindsight, we had COVID, so we lost all of our connection with our teachers, but then we also had a period, like I said, in October, which was the strike.
13:30:14 Where I lost connection with my teachers. And that entire time there was it was really interesting because I used that entire time to literally apply to colleges. Like we weren't really getting many… many homework assignments because teachers and students couldn't really communicate with each other. It was kind of like prohibited under this union strike.
13:30:31 Until the deal was found or made and so essentially that entire time, I think I applied to Like, I would say at least like 15 universities and um And over like 30 scholarships and all this, you know, grants. I was just doing everything I could. I was getting teacher recommendations.
13:30:50 And I was just trying to… use the time as wisely as possible. I was also doing like leftover assignments that they kind of had sent us like beforehand. There was long packets.
13:31:00 Of like review and just keep our minds fresh. But that time, I kind of ironically.
13:31:06 Allowed me to like really hone in. It was a total productive period because If I didn't have that, it would have been, you know.
13:31:13 Course full year of senior year course load, three AP classes, like seven different extracurriculars and my application. So that kind of That truly was kind of a blessing in a sense, even though it was obviously a difficult period um
13:31:27 But in terms of Northwestern specifically, it's kind of funny because as I mentioned earlier.
13:31:33 I always kind of have this idea that it's like, oh, it's a great school, but I'm not going to get in and At that point, I wasn't a great test taker either.
13:31:41 Like tests, depending on what unit tests in classes, I'm great at, but when it comes to very specialized standardized tests that are very… have high constraints with time limits. It's a little more difficult for me. I'm just not a great test taker. So that was a big
13:31:56 Indicator as to me as to why I felt like I couldn't get into Northwestern because they value high test scores and Usually it's like very high, you know, past 32 on an ACT, 33 kind of even 34.
13:32:09 And higher. And so I was like, yeah, that's going to be difficult so The full truth is that when I applied to Northwestern.
13:32:19 This is kind of a bad thing to say, but I didn't think I was really going to get in. So I kind of just applied in a way where I can't remember if I, I believe I saw my test scores, but I, um.
13:32:31 I wrote the essay over like a few days and um And I kind of just talked about my experience obviously like being near, like always having grown up near Evanston um But I also talked about another experience which was
13:32:47 Summer of junior year of junior of high school, which was summer 2019. I did a like one or I think a two week program, which was a tester kind of A-B testing starter program that Northwestern rolled out, which was called, um.
13:33:02 Nhsi cherubs, but it was for neuroscience. So there's cherubs for like the film academy, which a lot of people have done as well who ended up going to school with me.
13:33:11 But that was like a longer program and it was more fleshed out. This was like a first, the first time they ever rolled this out. It was called The neuroscience chartups program, I did it with like five other students from from around like
13:33:24 Chicago. And it was an incredible program. I mean, initially I came in as biology. So I was really interested in biology throughout my high school career.
13:33:31 Hmm.
13:33:32 That was a program that completely fascinated me and it was just incredible. I mean, we learned about all these different types of facets and speech language pathology, audiology, neuroscience as a whole, and then we we presented to like seven, not seven, sorry, seven department heads from across the Francis Searle department.
13:33:51 And so that was an incredible program. And I spoke about that And I touched on that in my experience kind of visiting in the summer, living on campus, like in Slivka.
13:34:00 For the first time, which is really great kind of kind of meshing with the other students and working together, collaborating on these presentations, learning about all these aspects.
13:34:10 And so I submitted that and that was the, I think I submitted that if Northwestern has a reaction, I did that or I did regular decision.
13:34:18 Got it.
13:34:18 But… In terms of… what actually like decided, I guess like why I picked it because it was between initially like I was going to go to michigan the University of Michigan Ann Arbor. And a few things that played into the role of
13:34:33 Deciding that was deciding that was First one being I got into Michigan well before Northwestern. Northwestern was one of the last acceptances I got. It was during COVID in March of 2020.
13:34:42 And at that time, Michigan was kind of the school that I thought it was the best academically that I got into. And, you know, it seemed pretty it seemed like I had an incredible biology program again because that's what I was interested in when I applied.
13:34:56 I wasn't thinking about film. And so I was like, I was going to go there.
13:35:00 What really was the difference was I got into Northwestern. It was close to home, which I like because I could come back on weekends.
13:35:07 They were very generous with grants and financial aid, which Michigan was not. They were expecting like a full price sticker.
13:35:15 Hmm.
13:35:14 And… And like I said, the three key things which were educational pursuits an understanding of diversity in culture and information because I grew up with that in my middle school And I was very, very lucky to actually have gone to the high school I went to because it
13:35:32 Was at the time for about five years. Not sure if it still is, but it was ranked as the number one most diverse high school in Chicago, which was really… really cool ranking to have.
13:35:43 Mather High School. Yeah.
13:35:42 What was the name of the school? Okay. And this was a public school
13:35:47 Yeah, Chicago Public Schools is part of the Chicago public school program or the network.
13:35:51 Yep. Got it. Okay, excellent. I want to talk a bit about your experiences at Northwestern.
13:35:59 It sounds like you were from 2020 to 2024. Is that accurate?
13:36:00 Sure. Yes, that is September 2020 to June of 2024. I graduated last June.
13:36:10 Thank you.
13:36:08 Belated, congratulations. So tell me about, you mentioned studying film at Northwestern.
13:36:17 Yep.
13:36:17 What was the process of arriving to that major? And then tell me about your experiences in the academic environment of Northwestern. What was that like for you?
13:36:25 Yeah, great question. As I said, initially, I came in as biology.
13:36:31 Mm-hmm.
13:36:30 And the road from biology to film actually went through the entirety of freshman year and it It took a lot of turns, but the way I arrived to film, to answer your first part of the question was.
13:36:40 I applied his biology. I got into Northwestern. I went. And basically, like after the first quarter or maybe during the first quarter, I looked at the biology handbook and realized that you needed like three organic chemistry classes And I did not like organic chemistry. I was good at chemistry, but I just had the worst experience in high school. I did not want to do orgo.
13:37:00 And because of that, I was just like. All right. You know, the dream of being a pediatrician is not going to happen anymore so It's pretty incredible how certain classes, they can really rub you the wrong way. And they're just, I mean, they're just difficult too. And sometimes they're not for people, which makes sense. And so that was
13:37:15 That was the key to get out of biology. I then went to economics because I really kind of wanted a business background, but Northwestern doesn't have a business major on the undergrad. It's only in Kellogg.
13:37:23 So I was like, all right, I guess I'll do this. Took a few classes throughout winter quarter. So now we're in winter of 2021.
13:37:31 Throughout freshman year again. I thought it was interesting, but didn't like how theoretic or didn't like how like how non-application heavy it was and more about charts and graphs and kind of theorizing about what could happen as opposed to actually like
13:37:43 Implementing those techniques, more of like the business side would have been, I think, interesting to me.
13:37:49 So by the end of the by the middle of spring quarter, now we're talking May of 2021.
13:37:55 I spoke to my advisor and I said, what's the process for Or sorry, actually, let me talk about before that how I arrived to this.
13:38:07 Mm-hmm.
13:38:05 You asked how I got to film The main reason was Throughout my entire freshman year, the end of the first quarter.
13:38:14 We talked about how I used resources to kind of learn about universities, which were those videos like Nicholas Che's Day in the Life, Elliot Choi.
13:38:23 Productivity and we can in Vanderbilt XYZ. Those videos inspired me to actually start, I had a YouTube channel, but I wanted to rebrand it because it was a bunch of, you know.
13:38:31 Content you make when you're seven years old and you know like you're like a goofball. So I privated those videos because they were terrible. And, um.
13:38:38 And I started fresh and I basically made a video said welcome welcome to my channel, which came out in December of 2020, like near the end of December.
13:38:46 And that was going to, it was the preface to say this channel will be about making videos about college life, about getting into university and just tips about how to navigate that space and your life as well.
13:38:56 So that kind of launched this YouTube series that started really in January of 2021 when I arrived to campus into my winter quarter in freshman year.
13:39:04 Hmm.
13:39:05 And I just started making videos. It was something that I loved to do. It was during COVID, so I couldn't do much of anything since we were on campus and There was a lot of limitations.
13:39:14 And so I just showed my life during COVID, while living on campus.
13:39:19 Started making these videos and I was doing about a I think I did the average and I think it was like 1.7 videos a week.
13:39:26 For almost, I think like 20 weeks, I was like very consistent Which I still, which I wish I was still now, but very consistent in terms of like, because the way I saw it was I wanted to give back to people who were like me trying to find a bunch of content, especially about Northwestern since I couldn't find much. It was more just like faculty videos at that time.
13:39:45 So that was a big key. And I just loved what I was doing. I thought it was so cool to like kind of produce your own content and show like what a day in the life can be like or what your dorm is like or what, you know.
13:39:56 Saturday or Friday or going to the gym or whatever, all these different activities excuse me, you could be doing would be visually like and so Because of that, that trend continued and I fell in love with just storytelling Like I said, producing content, helping others to get into college um
13:40:15 Answering questions if people had them, for example, on a common one video someone could say What are your advice on the Northwestern essay? The next video I'd make is the why Northwestern essay. And so I would just try to
13:40:28 I would try to tailor the content towards the people that were prospective students in the next year and then the subsequent years following mine As well as kind of show what I tried to do was try to show a genuine full picture of what my life was like in freshman year.
13:40:44 And going forward as much as I could. And so your question to why did I write the film, it was a mix of making content that I thought was really fun to make and being able to share my story about what it was like to live on campus.
13:40:56 As well as… I guess trying something unique that was different. I wanted to explore something that I love because like I said, all When I was growing up, my dad and I would always go see movies at that theater in Evanston from, I don't even remember, the earliest one I can remember is like 2008. And we would do that.
13:41:13 Up until ironically, the renovations happened, which were like three years long but It was just a staple in my life. And my dad and I love movies. Like we went to Hollywood because we wanted to explore all these unique
13:41:25 Facets of like just cinema history and so It was a mix of that. It was a mix of creating content that I felt evoked emotions from my audience and that they could resonate with.
13:41:36 And also a mix of trying to maybe tailor the content I was making at that time. I think this my main thought process too was.
13:41:43 How could I kind of streamline the content I was making at the time?
13:41:46 And like couple it in a way with my major so that I could continue to make better content, learn the skills And then maybe do it at least throughout those four years of college and just continue to help people. At the root of it, it truly was a kid
13:42:02 In my shoes um maybe had a difficult time looking through youtube Google, whatever it was, trying to find information about how they could get into universities and what it looked like from a student like potentially them And how they could see themselves
13:42:19 Living and kind of interacting in the day-to-day lives in the university so that was the root idea. And that kind of started that trend and the interest into film.
13:42:29 And then, yeah, you asked the second question. I'm kind of forgetting. I'm sorry.
13:42:29 That's awesome. Hmm. You've kind of answered it.
13:42:39 Sure, sure. Sure.
13:42:35 I'm thinking about… A couple other things you just mentioned now, because I did that content creation part um And so I'm wondering Right. So who is your audience for the content that you create?
13:42:53 Sure.
13:42:52 And how have you… thought about engaging with them like can you think of any stories of what that's looked like either on the online platforms that you're using also in person, if you've engaged with anyone In per what that's been like.
13:43:06 Yeah. That's a great question. Yeah, that's really good. I like the way you phrased that. So in terms of the beginning of that, the first question.
13:43:22 What did they show you?
13:43:15 My audience, I can get you like the actual analytics, but YouTube, from what I believe it is, what YouTube actually shows me, you know, unfortunately, there's… sort of discrepancy from my point of view, the audience that I have, the target audience when I was making this was
13:43:37 Hmm.
13:43:31 It was always going to be 17 to like 30 year olds who are prospective students But it doesn't have to be undergrad. It could be undergrad. It could be grad students. It could be people coming back to school just to like
13:43:44 Experience maybe what a class could be like or what walking through a dorm or a university hall or A class from XYZ could be like and their interactions with that. And also the collaboration aspect.
13:43:56 A lot of my videos, I also try to show what it's like studying for exams with friends working together in libraries. I try to show what your life could look like potentially as a vicarious element. I'm using quotations.
13:44:09 If you were to experience it. And so that was a big point. So again, the target audience would be And it's still, honestly, I still see it as like the 17 and 30 year olds. Now my content is kind of skewed into a few different things. So it could be a little more wide ranging but
13:44:23 It was always like 17 to 30 year olds undergrads, but I would get comments and messages from grad students all the time who were like, hey, I'm doing, you know.
13:44:30 My MBA here, I'm 27 years old. I'm living off campus.
13:44:34 What do you recommend for groceries for like bills? What do you recommend to stay? All these cool I would just get out these messages all the time and it was really unique. And that kind of falls into your next question, which I think was, did you ever have any interactions in person?
13:44:47 Yeah, I would say they… They started to happen at the end of freshman year.
13:44:53 The entirety of sophomore year was, I think, the most I would ever get because I think that was at the point where the new class was applying. They were coming into school and I had set all these videos up in freshman year so that they could watch them. And then that's like when they would kind of interact because Essentially, you had my class was now sophomore class and then you had the freshman class coming in 2025 who's graduating this year.
13:45:14 And they would always come up to me. So I would be in the dining hall getting food at like Sergeant Hall.
13:45:18 And I would have students come up to me and we were still wearing masks. So it was obviously a little different.
13:45:24 Hmm.
13:45:24 They would, I guess, see my facial structure or maybe wearing like my backpack. They would say, hey, are you Yanni?
13:45:30 You know, and I would say yes. And they'd be like, oh my gosh, I watched your videos. You helped me get into university. You can help me get into here.
13:45:35 And it was incredible. I mean, it was really unique to see like right directly in front of me the results of what I was doing.
13:45:42 And that the results were exactly what I was hoping for.
13:45:46 Whether it was a prospective student getting into Northwestern or University of Michigan or Wesleyan or Vanderbilt or whatever universities they would talk about and they would want they hope to get into. But it was also the the understanding that the videos I made actually gave them some sort of value as opposed to just
13:46:04 Mindless scrolling or mindless entertainment that they could watch, that there was something that they each took away, whether it was You helped me really zero in on this part of the essay and the why Northwestern statement, or you showed me what it was like to live in a suite style dorm in Kemper Hall and
13:46:19 And because of that, you know, I really… I really ranked like that as a high number for my sophomore year you know dorm And I ended up getting all these unique things. And so that was really unique. And I just, in a sense, it was a sense of accomplishment
13:46:35 Mostly in the factor that I was able to like what I, what my idea of these videos were initially like that was actually coming to life. It wasn't so much the idea of like, oh, wow, people know me.
13:46:49 It was more about the fact that you know, the things I made, the content I produced is actually creating value that people could take away from.
13:46:57 And there's a direct result coming from that. That was very powerful especially like I think every single time was incredible because I always heard different perspectives and people would give different answers every time.
13:47:07 And it was in person a lot, like I said, all throughout sophomore year, junior year, even senior year. But it was especially Like it was most common on social media. I would get them in comments. I would get Instagram direct messages all the time.
13:47:20 And one thing I guess I… I thought was really unique too was I could just I could message them back. So they would say a lot of them would also say, I watched your video. Do you have any advice on
13:47:31 A student who's interested in the research department and or in the research department for, let's say like a specific type of biology, like biological process. And obviously I didn't have that expertise But if I knew a friend of mine or someone I knew on campus that was studying that, I would actually connect them. And so there was, again, a powerful
13:47:51 Kind of sense of collaboration in terms of the networking aspect. And it almost gave, I was trying to also give the students a preview of what If you got in or if you were coming next year, what the aspects could be like in terms of
13:48:05 Connection and bridging that gap. And it was great. I really thought that was, and I still think to this day when I get messages and when people come up to me, it's It's the most kind of impactful part of the work because it shows that there's clearly value again being taken from that. I think that's the key.
13:48:22 Um… My mind is going in a couple different directions.
13:48:27 You're good.
13:48:38 I'm trying to make sure I hit every single one so we get better.
13:48:33 You're really good at answering multiple questions I have at the same time. And so now I'm like, okay, what questions do I want to You very much are doing so. It's great.
13:48:43 Yeah.
13:48:46 Let me think.
13:48:51 Hmm. Okay, you mentioned something about like admissions and stuff like this. Were you ever approached by like admissions at Northwestern or like an official university body?
13:48:56 Sure.
13:49:01 Administrator to like collaborate? Was there anything like that that occurred?
13:49:07 That's a great question. I kind of wish that happened. But… No, yes and no. So I would say no to the direct question because Throughout freshman year to sophomore year and junior year, like basically throughout the college career, I never really had any faculty or anyone come from admissions to say, hey, we should do a joint post. And I would also argue that, not argue, I would also say
13:49:30 That things like that actually started to happen more and more as I became like more of an upperclassman because I noticed that obviously the space for content creation has completely just bounce. What am I saying?
13:49:44 Has gone completely in the upper direction since COVID. And so I think just admissions has figured out that that's really important. They've started doing it more.
13:49:52 But I would say that in a sense, there's a yes part to that answer to that question because I was also working or I joined as a work study program because I needed to do work study and I was trying to figure out what I could do.
13:50:06 And I saw an opening for Northwestern Student Affairs Marketing, which was the marketing department on campus.
13:50:12 I saw it for like photographer and videographer and like editor and all this stuff. And I like did an interview And it was, I never really had a job before in this area. So I kind of just like pitched myself and, you know, said.
13:50:23 I don't have a ton of experience, but I make video content and I'm always adaptable and I'm actually very grateful for my boss, Jill Norton. She took a chance on me.
13:50:32 One of the best bosses I've ever had. And so she's brought me on. And at that point it was middle of sophomore year when I joined, I believe. Yes, it was January of 2022. So I was still a sophomore.
13:50:42 And I joined on the marketing department. And so because I had that job and I kind of had access to the entire university and department heads and all that.
13:50:52 I made joint content with the university and I kind of just use my skills that I knew already and the people I knew and the understanding. I had a very good perspective on students because I would talk to them a lot and I was one as well in that time. So I knew what was happening, what people kind of
13:51:07 For the most part we're looking for. So I always use that to help aid Northwestern Student Affairs, Residential Life, Admissions, and… In a sense, like I didn't directly work with admissions or Northwestern University, but For example, I did like a video for Northwestern dance marathon in 2022 and it did really well. Everyone really loved it. It kind of blew up and
13:51:38 Hmm.
13:51:29 Northwestern did like use some of my content. They asked for some of the content, which I gave them and then It was made into a few reels which like blew up. And so I always kind of had like, I always had networking access and like had relationships with those people. It was just like, we didn't always combine content, but
13:51:45 It was always available if they ever needed something. I was very flexible with that as well. And I think it was because of the job I worked, which made the access even more kind of the ease of it even more efficient too.
13:51:58 Yeah, yeah, yeah. In any point of your content creation journey, have you received like sponsorships or endorsements and if so like what has that looked like
13:52:08 Yeah. Kind of mostly mostly one, but I guess you could maybe say two I guess I'll say two that I've like taken and built relationships with. I think I've been asked or I've got an email, I had gotten emails and I've been texting a bunch of like messages. I probably had gotten like over 20, but I didn't always
13:52:28 Either fulfill them or I wasn't available to do them. A lot of them were a mix of affiliate links that they would say.
13:52:37 Share this product. And then if you put in your description and someone buys it, you know, they get 30% off and you get a cut of that.
13:52:42 Commission of that. I kind of didn't love that specifically because I almost felt like it was becoming It was becoming what the channel wasn't. I say this as the channel is a mix of a million things right now but
13:52:54 At that time, the channel was college focused and so I didn't want to take anything away from that. The idea was I wanted to give free advice and experience to people so that they could take it away. And I didn't want to add an element of
13:53:06 Oh, by the way, buy this product. I didn't like the idea of almost putting paid ads in it.
13:53:11 And I also should preface that this entire time, I've never been monetized. I never… like was doing it for that. And I also never had monetization access so people always tended to think like some people would say, oh, you're doing this for the money, X, Y, Z.
13:53:26 It's absolutely not true. A lot of times I would actually be losing money because I was investing in these videos in a way where I was getting camera gear, all this stuff. I wasn't really making money.
13:53:32 Hmm.
13:53:35 Again, the big emphasis was trying to just be genuine. But to your question, I did take one, which was a, it was a they were called Basecamp. I'm actually still pretty good relationship with them.
13:53:50 They had reached out to me, loved my college content. Love that I did like day in the life and I had all these campus shots and they were like.
13:53:57 We have this new electric skateboard line coming out. If we send this to you, would you do a review on it and just kind of using some of your vlogs? I'm like, absolutely.
13:54:06 And I kind of lied and said, yeah, I always ride skateboards. At that time. I've never, I'd never gone on a skateboard in my life.
13:54:12 They sent the product. And I also was kind of wary. I'm like, these people are not going to send anything. They ended up actually sending it. I go downstairs in my Kemper mail room and the product or the package is like.
13:54:22 It felt like 10 feet long. It was so massive. It was a struggle to get it up to my room.
13:54:27 I remember I got up to my room, I opened it and I'm like, oh man, this is actually serious. So I don't know. I guess like you always had to be wary of scams too, because I would get like a bunch of stuff, whether it was scams and real. So I was always cautious. But I remember I'm like, okay, I have to actually make this video. So I like watched a YouTube video on how to ride a skateboard and I just like kind of learned like over two hours on campus. I'm like, all right, we'll figure this out.
13:54:49 And so I ended up making a video for them, which was basically a product review, but just kind of showing campus as a whole, like in a day life kind of thing.
13:54:58 And so they loved it. It's on their website. I think it's on their YouTube as well. And that was really cool.
13:55:03 They sent me like, it was like a $750 skateboard and then they gave me like a bunch of the like supplies And then every now and then, like if new like attachments or things come out, they'll like send me that too.
13:55:13 I really like that one. I just thought that was, I thought, and I will say I took that one specifically because I felt it was actually comparable to what I was doing.
13:55:23 You know, a big thing about getting on campus is like you either really walk or at that time people were biking. Now you could say people are taking Lime scooters or they're buying electric scooters.
13:55:32 But I found that like walking was great, but at times like There was a point that I also wanted to be able to move kind of more freely, especially carrying camera gear when I was filming so It just made sense kind of getting electric skateboard and being able to review it as something that was a function of
13:55:49 Maneuvering campus I thought was just very like helpful too. And I will say the other one was a… wasn't really paid. It was just the company reached out to me, the CEO of a company called Pillar reached out to me and they were in the early stages.
13:56:03 And it was essentially like a version of link tree if you know what Linktree is, you put in your bio and yeah, exactly. You would just segment a bunch of different links and made it easier into one place.
13:56:14 So they had their own version of that, but it was cool because you can make it, it was very customizable and you could do all these like a really unique kind of icons and all this stuff. So they reached out to me. I hopped on a call with them and he's like, yeah, we're just kind of testing it out.
13:56:26 This usually is like $100 membership a year, but we want to give it to you. All these creators on college campus to see If it helps at all with people, if they're looking in that, like when people go into the description and maybe they're navigating
13:56:38 If there's a certain product that they want to look at that they want to buy or whether it's because I used to also do two like kind of… coaching sessions. I did a lot of those for free as well. So I would put like my link and I would say.
13:56:51 Click on the pillar link and you could like go to a Zoom calendar and you could book like a session with me. 30 minutes, X, Y, Z.
13:56:58 And so that was really helpful because it kind of consolidated all the links I would have in my description, whether it's like website, social media, everything kind of one.
13:57:03 Yeah. Who are you coaching? Exactly.
13:57:09 Oh.
13:57:07 Just prospective students, like a lot of people I knew, it was family friends it was It was people who would literally just reach out to me. I call it coaching, even if it was like a 30 minute session and they had a question just because I grouped all together.
13:57:17 Yeah. Yeah.
13:57:18 Again, from those videos, I would just scale like I would get hundreds of DMs on Instagram and I would respond to every one, but I didn't always have time. So I would say.
13:57:26 You know, feel free to just hop on a Zoom with me.
13:57:29 And it was easier because I could kind of spend my time with them and I would help them with an essay, you know, look through it or If they needed like advice, how to, you know, certain way to kind of show their frame for a university or whether it was
13:57:44 Understanding like letter of continued interest, all these types of things.
13:57:50 They were always free. I don't think I ever charged for one of these sessions.
13:57:47 And were these paid or were these free?
13:57:53 And why did you feel like it was important to do these sessions?
13:57:58 Well, for, I think it was two things. I think the one was I could give more time to them as opposed to responding on a DM when I was walking to class. I felt like I was kind of like, I couldn't give a lot of information. I was just like, yeah, you know, there's this, this and this but When I was on a Zoom call with them, whether it was 30 minutes or an hour, I could actually listen to what they really needed. So if they needed me to maybe look over an essay portion, then I could help them
13:58:21 I would give my advice on it. I would help them make anecdotes or make the essays more personal to the actual application and Yeah, and show the university that there's that there's these there's obviously a person behind this. It's not just like an application because again
13:58:35 Fortunately, numbers, it's a numbers game and we try to what we want people to stand out in a way that isn't just a number.
13:58:41 But I also felt it was important. I also felt it was important not to charge because in that point you make it transactional and I was… And this is also coming from someone who very easily could have done that because, you know.
13:58:55 I wasn't really making money throughout college and wasn't really making money in general so There was kind of like a moral thing there. I kind of thought about it. I was like, maybe I should charge, maybe I shouldn't.
13:59:08 But yeah, it was more of just understanding that there's There's people that I was already giving free knowledge to it and it And I really wanted to… delve deeper if it was possible. And you know, to be honest, I had a lot of time in between classes because I didn't really do a lot of extracurriculars, I guess.
13:59:25 Youtube was an extracurricular for like that those few years so um So I was like, yeah, I have the time. And if I don't, I'll just, you know, I'll make sure that I can reschedule.
13:59:29 Hmm.
13:59:34 But yeah, it was nice. I mean, even there was like, even my close, like family, like even cousins who were younger than me or close friends of family, like family friends kids They were younger. I would just have them call me. Like it was even easier that way too.
13:59:47 Awesome. Personally, I'm going to say that's a really great thing that you did.
13:59:53 I watched before this. Your video on, I think it's your senior year.
13:59:54 Thank you.
13:59:58 Oh, sure. Thank you.
14:00:07 No, no. Absolutely.
13:59:58 Gain a life video. And great video. I think a couple things stood out to me and I know I'm asking you to jog your memory of something you posted almost like But can you walk me through, especially as someone who studied like film, right?
14:00:14 Sure.
14:00:14 What your process was like from ideation. I want to make this senior year video to I'm posting it online to be received by other people. What is that process?
14:00:20 Sure. Right.
14:00:25 Look like for you?
14:00:26 Yeah, that's a good question. Breaking it down. I like what you said in terms of the kind of like the brainstorming of it, I think too.
14:00:36 So like when I, before I was, the funny thing is.
14:00:39 Before I got into the film program, I was making, I had made like 30 videos before I even got into the film program and They did well, but then I realized the first day I took a film fest that there was three things that I just
14:00:52 Did not know what I was doing about. So I like basically there's a thing called an exposure triangle and there's like certain rules about filmmaking.
14:00:59 Essentially, the way it is, is if you shoot a video at a certain frame rate, the shutter speed, which is just a fancy word for It's basically the amount of time that the sensors open on your camera for light to come in.
14:01:11 That shutter, that should always be double whatever your frame rate is.
14:01:15 And so when you shoot at 24 frames per second, which is kind of the standard or 30, it should be 48 or 60, just double.
14:01:21 I had no idea that was a thing. And I would be shooting at like 60 frames per second at one over 400 shutter. And it was like, then I look back and I'm like, yeah, that's why my footage was quite choppy. But you don't think about that because like I didn't have the idea. And so… That's just kind of the preface because then I slowly, if you watch the videos, you'll notice that just quality becomes better. Um.
14:01:40 And so, you know, being in the film program, you learn a lot of of the technology use, but you also learn about the theory and like the techniques to do it as well, which was the key and so In a sense, my storytelling became better because I started to learn more. And I would also teach myself. I mean, I was up till 4 a.m. Every single night
14:02:02 Learning how to be better, learning how to like watching videos, doing research about film history, just understanding how to like make content better and to improve my storytelling skills. And so That kind of leads directly to all those videos as they got better throughout sophomore year and junior year and obviously senior year.
14:02:20 And by the time that I had done the, or I was planning to do the senior year video, which I think you're, are you talking about the day in life, just the Northwestern senior? Is that the one?
14:02:29 Yeah, right. So that video I guess what I could say is throughout junior year, I actually studied abroad in Europe. And so I thought during that time, I was kind of like very busy and I just forgot to make videos and I just like was very tired and
14:02:44 There was a point, there was a pretty big lull throughout the middle, the beginning and the middle of the junior year where I just wasn't making a lot of videos because I just was very packed and busy, which I look back and I'm like, I wish I made more because I, you know, it was nice to be consistent and
14:02:57 There's always people needing value. And so that was kind of that point where I just wasn't making a ton of videos. But by the beginning of senior year, I told myself that If I don't make anything else, as long as I make one last day in the life of a senior.
14:03:11 Then I will be happy because I wanted to I wanted to… show at least some sort of progression from the old videos to the new videos.
14:03:22 In terms of the, I guess, like the style, sure, and the quality, whatever, but more importantly about what my life has become since because it had also been a like almost a year since someone had seen a video that I made.
14:03:36 Hmm.
14:03:36 And so I wanted to basically say, here's what's been up since we last talked. And I felt it was important because There's also a lot of comments I was getting and people were messaging me saying, when are you going to make a video? Can you make a video about this? Can you talk about
14:03:49 What you've been doing in college, like what's going to happen post-graduation? I was like, yeah, you know.
14:03:53 I almost feel like I owe it to… I feel like I owed it to myself, like most importantly, because I just, I didn't want to leave without making like some something that kind of tied everything up and so It was this idea since like quite literally September of 2023. And I was like, I'm going to make it, I need to make it, I need to make it.
14:04:11 And then April comes around and I'm like, all right, well, I'm graduating in two months. I better make this freaking thing.
14:04:17 So I kind of just started planning in my head. I'm like, all right, I'm going to do this. You know, it's going to be, um.
14:04:23 I should shoot it like the way I shot other ones because the truth is, while it completely is genuine or while it completely is like following my day.
14:04:33 It does take some planning because, you know, I kind of have to like think about what the shots I'm going to be doing is.
14:04:38 What the story is as you follow, like how it's going to end, all this stuff. And, um.
14:04:42 And that was the big change. As the videos continue to come out, they slowly became more kind of, I guess, in a sense, what's the word structured in a storytelling way and so by that senior year video, that was kind of all my techniques being shown and just what I learned.
14:05:00 Yeah, structured in a storytelling way. Tell me what that means.
14:05:05 You might have a different understanding of that as someone who studies storytelling.
14:04:58 But essentially, I mean, the way it worked Yeah, yeah, absolutely. It just…
14:05:08 No, sure. Yeah, absolutely. It's a great question. What I mean by that is if you… if we take like one of the first day in the life videos I ever did, which was, I think, freshman year, that video was kind of all over the place. And to be honest, like.
14:05:20 I think I posted content from another video I was going to do into it because it kind of worked, but there was no structure in the sense that like.
14:05:29 I kind of just was like, let me make a video and let me just let me throw stuff together like In that moment, I was like, oh, the longer the video, you know, people are going to like it better. It's going to be better like a four minute video because they can like see all the different things I'm doing is going to be higher.
14:05:42 Interest in it maybe and people could take something away. And so there wasn't structure in the sense that I had no plan for it. It was just like, shoot, whatever the heck happens that day and we'll figure it out.
14:05:52 And that's kind of what happened. Like I shot whatever happened that day and I was like in the edit, I was stressed because it took forever.
14:05:58 But the structure and the storytelling are important because they they essentially like also allow you to make it more, I guess, smooth throughout the entire thing. So it allows the viewer to watch it easily.
14:06:11 It also allows me when I'm in the editing room to not have to worry about everything because I have it all in my head or I wrote it as a storyboard.
14:06:19 And so that point being like, as the days led up to, I think I actually, what's ironic is I think a year ago today, I filmed it, which is funny because I got like a reminder on Snapchat or something.
14:06:28 But it's pretty perfect timing. But I remember like the few days before I was just kind of planning. I'm like, okay.
14:06:28 Awesome.
14:06:34 So, you know, I'm going to film obviously breakfast and certain shots I want to angle it this way, that kind of things like you, you kind of plan out shot types and then I also kind of planned the day because all my days were always planned. Like, you know, I have my Google calendar and I have activities I'm doing interview
14:06:51 Okay.
14:06:50 Lunch with my friend, you know, dinner, X, Y, Z, going to the gym. And so I just planned that essentially. But in terms of the structure, it was better because I knew kind of exactly what I was doing like it wasn't
14:06:59 I'm just going to film whatever happens. In terms of the uh like Because when you film whatever happens, there's also a chance that you're kind of just filming yourself like working on your laptop too, which is sometimes what it is but
14:07:14 I also wanted to make sure that people could allow like I could speak during the video just straight to the camera because at the end there's about a three minute sequence where I speak directly to the camera and I just talk about what's going on.
14:07:23 I thought that was important because there was a few things on my mind, especially that I wanted to talk about and so I didn't do that a lot. And I felt that that would actually… give viewers more of a…
14:07:35 I guess an update about where I've been, what's next, essentially. So I did that a few times in the video. I had breaks in between, you know, breakfast and gym where I talked about, you know, I'm getting dinner with or lunch with my friend and we're going to talk about the next few steps.
14:07:50 After that, I would talk directly to the camera about having this upcoming interview, which ironically was at the company I ended up working at in the summer.
14:07:56 Because I did get that job, which was really fun. It's kind of funny that I actually… Got the interview on film, which was really cool. That was a great interview, though. And I just talked about that. And then… Again, in between that by the end, it's like talking about this
14:08:10 Really cool graduation video I have planned that I'm going to be making just about the culmination of my life. And then like what my, what my life is like right now in the classes I'm taking.
14:08:19 What I'm doing for student affairs marketing. At that time, I was doing a Sam Mike end of the year compilation. So I talked about that. I was editing photos for it.
14:08:27 And I just, I like that there was structure and that I could talk to the camera and there was points that I could just say what was going on.
14:08:34 Hmm.
14:08:34 So it was a mix of shop planning just so I knew what the angles were like, it's a little easier to kind of film it when you know what you want to shoot um whether it's, you know, camera, wide shot right in front of my table of me eating or whatever, or in the gym xyz
14:08:51 Yeah.
14:08:50 That made it easy in terms of just shot composition and then storytelling, just making sure that I hit a few, like three key points I wanted to make sure I hit in the video because I thought that it was kind of going to tidy everything up together. So that was
14:09:05 That was kind of the… the idea behind it and then Yeah, it's just kind of filming and making sure that continuity is kind of a thing too. You don't want to make it disjointed. You want to make sure there's kind of flow between
14:09:20 And so that's just making sure, you know, I film some coverage, but There's a lot of elements. I mean, at the heart of it, I want to make sure that it's still genuine and still You know, interesting and interesting
14:09:33 And people can take value from it. That's the key. I mean, shots or whatever, like.
14:09:38 Film when you strip it away is storytelling. And if there's no story, then it's not a film.
14:09:41 It's really nothing at that point. It's just a visual kind of compilation.
14:09:51 Sure.
14:09:47 Thank you. Yeah, that's really… helpful. You said this word genuine that lingers. I'm wondering what for you translates as genuine in terms of the content you're making like what is what does that mean?
14:09:59 Yeah. Yeah. I said the word a lot, so I must have a reasoning, right?
14:09:58 When you say genuine content.
14:10:04 Yeah, no, I think, I mean, the word genuine is a word I tend to use a lot of my vocabulary because I actually do believe it. And I think Like the word to me just essentially means that what you say is what you do, right? So, or what you show is what you do essentially.
14:10:21 And while obviously in my videos, I'm not going to show every single thing I do because one, it'll be boring or two, it's confidential or I just don't want people to see it, perhaps.
14:10:29 When I say genuine, I mean that the things I actually say in the video I actually live by, and I'm being truthful too. And I could say pretty confidently that majority of all the videos I made.
14:10:42 Kind of based within higher education and college have been genuine in that sense. Like the things I talk about are the things I do.
14:10:48 And even as early on, like. When I watch older videos well before I even considered like the idea of switching to film, I'm talking about like January 2021 videos.
14:10:59 I watch it back and I like see this spark in me, which is like, there's such a clear love for what I'm doing. The passion is there. And that's why genuinity kind of follow suit with passion because like essentially when you're making something, if you really love what you're doing then
14:11:13 Everything you say is going to be genuine. It's going to be truthful and you are what you are basically doing and showing and so Yeah, I think… being genuine needs to be a pillar of whatever content you make if you're showing what you're doing or if you're showing yourself essentially.
14:11:33 No one's going to want to watch a video of someone basically putting on a facade and putting a mask of what they're doing. I mean, I remember I really resonated with like Elliot Choi because he would also like have shots and like I would also leave shots in of of like…
14:11:47 Unscripted things a lot just because I wanted people to like see what it was like. So I would show embarrassing things that happened to me. So I remember one video, it was like a day in the life and I was like leaving the dining hall.
14:11:57 And I was trying to get this shot of me like leaving my skateboard and I fell off the skateboard, like not, not like badly, but I was like, I'm going to keep this in so people know it's like, it's.
14:12:08 Yeah.
14:12:05 You know, things happen all the time. But i think I think, again, like going back to one of the things that resonated early on with Elliot Choi, for example, or even jay towns i mean what am I saying? J-towns was one of the first people I remember from watching Northwestern content and
14:12:20 I liked just the way that they filmed long segments and they messed up a lot and they stuttered like a lot of my videos, I'm stuttering. I mean, I'm stuttering now too. And it's just… That's what it is. You can't always film something that's perfect because
14:12:34 Sometimes you need to show people what is the thing that you would have cut out.
14:12:39 For them to see that you are actually just like them. And I think there's, it's always the sense of relatability.
14:12:44 That allow people to resonate with it.
14:12:52 No.
14:12:48 You mentioned some certain creators that influenced you. Are there creators at Northwestern that you've worked with and like what are those like interactions look like and like how do they, again, what purpose do they serve if any?
14:13:00 Yeah. Yes interact with. We haven't made a ton of videos together. I don't know if I've made, I don't know if I posted any specific videos with, there's a few other creators. There's It was like Fred Lou, who was in my class, who's a friend of mine. He was great, but he kind of, he did like a lot of TikTok content and then he moved to YouTube.
14:13:18 There was, what else am I thinking? There was Richard Yan, who… I didn't know well, but both of us, along with a few other creators were in a North by Northwest video, like a article because they interviewed us.
14:13:30 So I got to meet him. Really nice guy. He also, I think, was in a few films that I produced.
14:13:36 I knew Jay Tomas. I actually know Jay Towns pretty well. He was in one of the first films I ever worked on as a set and then We met again at a conference for marketing and then he was also, I worked with him last summer in my job at an ad agency because he
14:13:52 We were doing reruns for a commercial that he was in. So we talked again. He's a great guy.
14:13:57 But yeah, I'm not sure if I ever posted content with other creators, but we always like kind of planned ideas. We would bounce stuff off each other. Fred and I would always talk about different, like we'd go to dinner and talk about what works, what doesn't. I remember he was like one of the first people I pitched the graduation video to and he told me about his.
14:14:13 So we kind of just gave each other advice on each.
14:14:17 And then, yeah, same thing. I mean, Jay Talons, he would always give me advice about how to like make dorm videos. It took a lot of inspiration from everyone. I mean, the cool thing was a lot of us creators were making stuff at the same time.
14:14:29 And the fun, like my favorite thing is I look back on YouTube sometimes and I'll just see all these new like students making videos and it just.
14:14:37 It kind of… I mean, it's really cool to see, essentially, because it's like… Again, I'm going back to my senior year of high school where I didn't like, it was really now I think about like Jay Towns was one of the only people I remembered. No one really made content and
14:14:55 Yeah.
14:14:50 That's why I knew so little about like what university life was like. And again, the inception of why I wanted to I wanted to make content and so It's nice to see that like at this point, it's 2025, you know, five years later, all these new students are making videos, even with their phone. I mean.
14:15:06 Truth is, storytelling is storytelling regardless. You could shoot it on a REFX, like the best camera in the world, or you could shoot it on an iPhone 4. It doesn't matter as long as the elements are coming across like
14:15:19 Although we say like one thing, if a visual, if a film is made on a potato If the story comes across, then that's all I care about. Because I'd rather have a strong story and bad visuals over Great visuals and no story.
14:15:33 Because one is, again, I just kind of mentioned a few minutes ago, one is a highlight reel.
14:15:37 One is something that will actually give you emotional, give you value.
14:15:50 Mm-hmm. Oh, thank you.
14:15:42 Yeah. I'm wondering for you, because I think three things that stand out is your balance of like visuals and voice as well as music versus not music Tell me what you think those things play, like what role they play in storytelling.
14:15:57 Yeah.
14:15:57 Think about in the context of those videos you make or just like the specifics in your video or just like your content in general.
14:16:04 Yeah, sure. That's a good question too. Thanks for commenting on the music. I try hard on that one.
14:16:11 Yeah?
14:16:13 That was a big thing for me. I wanted the, I mean, again, going back to the genuine aspect, like a lot of the music in my videos are Like music I listen to every single day that I still listen to. I remember even just for an example, like I had a very like, I remember during the tail end of freshman year, I did like a, I tried to do like a 10 day vlog series or like a 10 part vlog series where I just consistently made vlogs.
14:16:35 It was very difficult. So I kind of like wasn't able to keep that up but throughout all those, I had like an intro kind of shot sequence where I would do a bunch of campus shots on a drone or my camera or whatever. And I would do like, it'd be like a cold open, like in the office, basically just like an introduction. And then the intro video and then start the video.
14:16:54 That intro video always had music like Odessa or Casbo. These are people I always listen to. And so… And it's funny because like sometimes i think There's a key here, like when you make content, you're always showing a part of yourself, like whether that is in my YouTube videos because it's me and I'm showing myself or whether it's a film I make that I'm not in.
14:17:11 I'm always going to have a piece of myself in there. And it's kind of there's… they're scared. There's parts that are terrifying when you put out content to the world because you're going to get judged, you're going to get ridiculed. You're going to get loved too but it's
14:17:22 There's always like for me specifically, like my music taste is kind of very specific, like very all over the place so My friends don't love my music, so I always found it like, I always kind of was nervous to put my music out, but I'm like, you know what?
14:17:35 Mm-hmm.
14:17:33 I'm going to keep what I do. And yeah, I think your question is is so valuable because it's so when it comes to, yeah, like certain scenes It's funny, like for me, when I would have ideas, I would always like have music in my head to scenes so
14:17:50 If I'm thinking about shooting something and I, you know, I'm like, I'm going to do my freshman year day in the life. Okay, I want this shot of me running across during I have this song in my head and then I'm thinking about sound design and all this stuff. It's like, I always kind of like music is so evocative, like emotionally evocative when it comes to
14:18:06 Creating content and so I think you can make a video without any music and it could be great because again storytelling is above all the key. But once you add a level of music and it feels like it fits
14:18:20 It completely changes the game. I mean, music, like even film, like a score can completely save a film.
14:18:27 Yeah, yeah, yeah.
14:18:28 And so to your question about how I go about like combining these elements and maybe my thought process is I remember like when I was coming on campus it was again, COVID, like freshman year winter we're talking about. It was completely locked down and you really couldn't do much. Like we could go on a walks or we could go like when we would go get tested, we would walk to the Jacob Center.
14:18:50 So I would like walk to the Jacob Center, get tested. And sometimes I would take the long way back because it was like the only time I could get outside. So I would walk all the way down to the arch, down past the seagull Visitor Center.
14:19:00 Through the lake fill and then back up to Bob where I lived. That was the dorm I lived in.
14:19:04 And throughout that entire time, I would just be listening to music because I, you know.
14:19:08 Kind of wanted to think about ideas or just like you just brainstorm and think about like certain things. And it was always peaceful doing a walk.
14:19:15 And sometimes I shuffle through music and I would hear songs that i could like I can't really describe it other than I could feel that those songs would be something that I could visualize. So there was like, I remember one specific song called The Little Things by, I think it was Casbo and another band.
14:19:32 And there was like that song, like every time I hear it, I always think about shooting a campus video because I would listen to it and I would be like.
14:19:38 This is a video I see of like all these beautiful canvas shots and showing my walk from Bob you know to Even like I would show myself getting tested. So it was like such a such a simple thing like that and
14:19:51 The simplest way to do it is like, sometimes you just need trial and error and things connect and um It's a big thing like you mentioned. I truly try to make my videos the most kind of, like I said, emotionally evocative they could be by adding
14:20:04 Various music layers.
14:20:06 Love that. How are you on time? Because I want to be mindful of your calendar. Do you have a hard stop at 2.30 or do you have a little bit more time?
14:20:13 I could probably do 235. I could probably do 235, yeah.
14:20:16 Okay. Okay, let's do until 2.35. I have a few more questions and i have like some Basic demographic things at the end.
14:20:21 Sure, sure. You got it. Yeah.
14:20:26 Okay, so… Let's think about the version of yourself that you present online, right? On your YouTube videos.
14:20:33 Yeah.
14:20:36 Would you say there's aspects of your identity that you tend to lean into more?
14:20:41 In your videos? And if so, which ones and which ones Why do you do so?
14:20:46 Yeah, good question, man. Nothing about that.
14:20:52 It's fair. Yeah, when it comes to Well, you said, when it comes to presenting personality I show in my videos or like the the yeah the persona i show i i would say I think the personality I kind of lean into is definitely
14:21:13 I mean, like there's part like if you watch the video, especially the earlier ones, like you could see like whenever I would walk past people, like I would der my eyes that way in the video just because it's like so foreign at that time. No one was really vlogging. I had this big rig too. I had like a Joby tripod.
14:21:27 Huge Canon camera, massive microphone on top. So it was like, it stuck out like a sore throat anywhere I went.
14:21:32 So there was always like, especially early on, I was like terrified of filming and I would actually argue that it does translate in the videos. People don't always say this, but I always watch them back and I could tell I was like cringing or I was like scared in that moment.
14:21:45 Because I just know my expression and I'm like, also a mask is on sometimes so you can't see my face, but it's like, I'm like, maybe that was a good thing. But, um.
14:21:52 There was parts, yeah, like the persona is like, I would say I'm an ambivert in life, which is I'm very extroverted and I'm very introverted but there's times when I'm one or the other too. It's not like I'm not…
14:22:04 I'm not extremely extroverted, but I'm not extremely introverted. I'm just kind of in that middle point and judging on the environment, it adapts essentially and so I would say like because of that, like even when I was filming It never got really easy. Like you kind of just do it. And there's always people looking at you. Like, I remember sophomore year when I started doing it, like continue to do it.
14:22:23 It was more people on campus restrictions lowered. So you saw more people even outside. And I just remember going to the dining hall and I was like freaking out and I'm just like filming and I'm like.
14:22:33 I'm like, because like at the end of the day, I'm just like.
14:22:35 I'm going to show what's there and the personality that I'm showing is someone who's ambiverted, who's like kind of freaking out that everyone's staring at me, but I'm still going to film it because I just remember every single time I was like worried or anxious about someone looking at me. It was just like, you know what? No, make the video because no one else is going to do it for you and
14:22:53 Hmm.
14:22:51 You know, it was always the idea of just trying to make complete videos so people, again, could see what it's like and Honestly, it's what it's like. I mean, a lot of people like you walk in a dining hall, it's pretty intimidating sometimes. So I'm going to…
14:23:03 Yeah.
14:23:02 I'm going to express that. But yeah, in terms of the personality, I definitely would lean into trying to be bold, I think, because again, I'm an ambivert, but I knew that I wanted to show the content. And with that, it does take courage in a sense because like.
14:23:17 Yeah, a thousand people looking at you isn't always the easiest thing. But I would say I'd always try to like show a sense of me being bold in that. And I would also lean into the idea of trying to give as much information as possible. I always try to be kind of like an outlet for the video, like to talk about what i was doing or
14:23:33 I remember a lot of the videos I would like be walking to a building or I would be in something and I would literally explain what it was. Like I'd be walking into North Say, this is Norris. This is the welcome center. You know, you can start XYZ Starbucks. Here's the store.
14:23:46 So I always try to give a sense of more knowledge that someone could take away if they never watched any video.
14:23:47 Yep.
14:23:54 Yeah.
14:23:52 That's something that I noticed in your videos as well. Let's talk about this. Have you acquired or developed any skills by virtue of creating content online And if so, what comes to mind?
14:24:03 Yeah, absolutely. I think… By nature of the game and what I studied, obviously filmmaking is like the biggest one. But I think tied for that would also be public speaking in a sense and um just kind of like communication in general. I think by making these videos i
14:24:20 I again, like I said, I became more bold, but I also spoke to more people. Like there's a kind of like a sense, like there's this thing like when you're also filming that people tend to just like look at you.
14:24:29 You also kind of speak to more people. Like I remember I would be filming a site like I would literally just be like studying on my laptop and I'd be filming like a time lapse shot so that I could speed it up and post and show that like it's being done faster so they don't have to watch the whole thing.
14:24:40 So the tripod would be right on the right of my camera. Like I'm looking at right here. It'll be just pointed at me and I'd be shooting a time lapse.
14:24:46 And someone would come up to be like, oh, hey, what are you shooting? I'm like, oh, I make YouTube videos. We're doing like this thing. And they'll be like, oh, that's so cool. So it's like, in a sense, by nature, I like.
14:24:53 Just increase my communication and I just met more people, which was indirect. And it was really cool in a sense. Like it was a result of it that I didn't even know what was going to happen.
14:24:57 Yeah.
14:25:02 Can you think of… I'm wondering how you think your storytelling generally has improved by virtue of doing content creation. And can you think of a specific example of what that's looked like? Maybe it's Yeah, I don't know what settings you might have
14:25:18 Seen that change or that growth. But what comes to mind?
14:25:29 Mm-hmm.
14:25:19 Yeah, sure. Yeah, absolutely. I mean, again, going, because it's a progression as everything is and it's kind of like a slow progression over time so I think like when, again, when I consider… Even, I'm trying, let me think of like a specific video
14:25:35 Sophomore year. I mean, when I even consider a video like I think it was called Studying for finals like spring quarter. It was a sophomore year spring quarter um I made it in March of like 2022. And I remember the video is like.
14:25:51 It's like a fine video, but the storytelling element isn't complete. Like it starts like in a, I'm in the library and I'm like finishing up an essay. Then I go get food.
14:25:59 Then it's about to be sunset. So I'm walking home. I filmed some drone shots, and then I work on these CTECs.
14:26:05 I guess you could say there's an arc, but I felt like even in that video, and that was still kind of recent.
14:26:10 My storytelling wasn't complete because like I mean, like in a sense, like what you're seeing is like, you know, I guess one of my final essays, but I could always like, I watched it again. I'm like, oh my God, I wish I, you know, had this or I wish I ended it with a more complete arc. So it's not just me.
14:26:25 Finishing writing evaluation you know it's me finishing up my journal for the night and talking about my goals for the next day like There's things I always look back. I'm like, yeah, that felt like 70% complete or 80% complete.
14:26:37 And I think your question to what caused it, maybe what what did you see that maybe shifted that it's going through the program, having great people in the program that would also like give me advice and they're like, yeah, there's
14:26:48 I hone it on my storytelling skills because I worked with other people who also did that. And so we worked on them and we developed them and reiterate them together. And so like by the end of senior year, when I made that graduation video, I mean, I think that's one of the best
14:27:01 I think that's one of my favorite videos because it's total storytelling. It's a complete journey.
14:27:08 Mm-hmm.
14:27:06 That you go on by the end, you know who I am and you also can see what the future is, I guess, for myself as well and so That's what I mean. Like progression increased because I would meet people
14:27:25 Yeah.
14:27:19 Like quite literally threw films for class, I would just work on my storytelling elements so like cinematography class, I made this video about like this one shot take and it's just about this guy who gets a call from his wife in the late hours of the night. And it turns out they're like pregnant. So it's just like this beautiful culmination at the end of his facial expression and
14:27:38 It's like you build, build, build, and eventually you just continue to get better because I can confidently say by even sophomore year, my storytelling skills were like crap. So… So that's it. Yeah, there's progression. And it was just working with Bill.
14:27:49 Yeah, yeah. Okay. That's awesome. Let me think, because I want to be super mindful of time yeah How has content creation changed your understanding of Northwestern.
14:28:05 And how has it changed, if at all, your understanding of Yanni?
14:28:10 Hmm. Yeah.
14:28:16 Interesting question. I think content creation, again, like I said, is like just completely exploded since COVID.
14:28:23 It was big, but since then you've had so many new influencers coming out, all these people making incredible content. I mean, every day you can learn something new when you hop on social media.
14:28:32 Which is really valuable. And so I think content creation has completely shifted.
14:28:38 In the educational space and for Northwestern specifically, because I think going back to my previous kind of point a few minutes ago.
14:28:46 You see all these students kind of gathering like inspiration and like reference videos from like even stuff I've made with people before me and all that And they're now making content. And it's just so valuable because Everyone is learning more about what
14:29:02 Like the space could look like in Northwestern, whether it's coming to campus, getting into them through the admissions taking a class, learning about dorms. I think it's just completely improving the overall kind of image that someone could see and take away when they look at a school like Northwestern or whatever, every university, but in this case northwestern
14:29:24 I think it's completely valuable and it's just And I think it's also going to continue to trend upward because there's always going to be more people and the access to making content is so much easier. You literally just need a phone
14:29:36 Yeah.
14:29:36 And you can start making stuff, whether it's YouTube, TikTok, Instagram, Reels, Twitter, whatever. That's the beauty of it. And it's something I really love as well.
14:29:44 And I think in terms of if content, how I see content creation that has changed like myself, um.
14:29:53 I mean, in a sense, it still inspires me. Sometimes there's things that like you can follow or that you can make and like at some point over a few years, you might get tired of it but Content creation just continues to fuel me. I mean, when I watch someone else make something
14:30:08 It gives me inspiration. I mean, every single time I'm on YouTube or social media, Instagram, whatever, TikTok.
14:30:14 I don't really use TikTok a lot. I usually use it to post but um But even Instagram, like if I see a reel that I like from Northwestern, from college YouTube or college influencer, you know, filming their day in life.
14:30:31 Yeah, yeah.
14:30:24 Favorite study spots on campus. I'll literally save it and I'll put it on a board and it'll be inspiration for a future video or it'll be Something I'll send to my friend who is a current junior in high school that's looking for information. And I'll send here's, you know, there's a great video I found. It's just like.
14:30:38 The curation of all this content continues to to just show me that there's such a valuable hub of knowledge that will just, I think, always continue to trend upward, especially with this emergence of new technology too.
14:30:53 That's awesome. Thank you so much. I want to ask a couple quick demographic questions just so I have these for my records.
14:30:56 Yeah.
14:30:59 So you're free to say like skip or pass if you don't want to answer any questions. Sound good?
14:31:00 Yep. Yeah, that's it.
14:31:05 Okay, so how would you say you identify in terms of gender?
14:31:09 Mel? White.
14:31:11 Race? Any specific ethnicity within that ethnic group?
14:31:16 Yeah, I mean, like European Greek, you could say.
14:31:19 Okay. And would you say you identify as Hispanic or Latino As an international student?
14:31:22 No, I'm not. I'm not. Nope.
14:31:28 As a first generation college student?
14:31:32 Is that… I would say, is this considered first generation low income or is it just first generation Okay, so I'm not a first generation student, no.
14:31:38 First generation. Would you say you identify as a low-income student?
14:31:46 Okay. Would you say you speak any languages other than English?
14:31:45 I was.
14:31:51 Yes, I do. I speak Greek. Relatively fluently compared to most people. And then I speak Spanish at like an advanced beginner kind of level.
14:32:00 Okay. And then… What's your current occupation?
14:32:06 Yeah, so currently I am a freelance videographer throughout Chicago and kind of the United States. And then I also co-manage a tourism based advertising agency.
14:32:16 Awesome. And are there other identity markers that I haven't mentioned that are important to you.
14:32:24 Um…
14:32:29 No, I think you hit them all. That's it.
14:32:33 What role do you think content creation will play in your life?
14:32:37 After college slash has it been playing in your life after college
14:32:41 Yeah, no, that's probably one of the most important questions. I mean, consecration will continue to serve me in my life and just in the occupation I do. I mean, I make videos for a living for clients, for businesses for universities
14:32:54 But again, I also co-manage a travel-based company. So we make literally short form content, social media.
14:33:00 And commercials for national tourism brands and um it really is going to continue. I'm going to keep reiterating the trend going upward because that is where the future is of social media content creation, the intersection of content creation and branding as like your individual identity.
14:33:16 Is so important. So I see it completely influencing my entire life because I'm going to be within this sector probably Just for whether I'm doing this or something else, it's always going to be in content creation.
14:33:28 You make me think I have one last double barrel question. So what is being an influencer mean to you?
14:33:31 Sure.
14:33:35 And do you see yourself as one of them?
14:33:39 Yeah, that's a good one. It's interesting.
14:33:44 I'm going to answer the question through more of like an example of a better way to answer it.
14:33:48 Sure.
14:33:50 I think being an influencer at its core means that you showcase showcase showcase certain elements of your life or your experiences on social media that people can take value from, whether that's you showing various makeup products that you are doing a brand deal with a company, whether that's you showing your life throughout your
14:34:13 College freshman year or, you know, showcasing you as a celebrity, X, Y, Z. I think all those in value and at the root of it.
14:34:21 Come from showing experiences that people could take some value from.
14:34:24 Now, in terms of like the influencer question, if I consider myself one.
14:34:29 I would say, try to say this in the most non-pretentious way, or non-narcissistic way.
14:34:36 I would probably not consider myself an influencer because I just try to see myself I don't like to prove myself in that because sometimes it kind of messes with me thinking that I'm more than I than that it is. And at the end of the day, I…
14:34:48 I see myself as just a creator who makes videos so that people could take some sort of value from.
14:34:55 And the example I was going to say is people tend to come up with me and say, oh, the best like YouTube influencers or creators for Northwestern are XYZ, J-town's four other people, my name's in there sometimes too. And it's like.
14:35:08 While I think that's a fair way of saying it, because sometimes we are like I From my definition, technically I am an influencer. But your question was, do I see myself as one? And I see myself as a creator and I think I'll always be one.
14:35:20 That's awesome. Thank you so much. This was lovely. I love hearing insight into your story.
14:35:22 Yeah. Oh. Yeah, it was such a pleasure.
14:35:26 Yeah, I thoroughly enjoyed hearing your story. You're like a very skillful storyteller, unsurprising.
14:35:31 Thank you so much. Sure.
14:35:32 So let me tell you what happens next. What happens next is I will, in the next week, send you a link to like an Amazon gift card. It's $20.
14:35:41 And then there's a form that you need to sign so I can confirm that you actually received it. And you just have to sign that and send it back to me.
14:35:46 Oh, sure. Yeah, no worries.
14:35:50 Are there any questions? I know you have to hop off pretty soon.
14:35:53 No, no. Yeah, I'm good for like another minute. No, I appreciate you. Your questions were incredible. I mean, some of them really made me think because uh Like I said, I've done a few, I did it like a something for the daily and then something for…
14:36:05 North by Northwest and some something else for something. I can't remember. But it was like I always kind of had an idea what it was about. These questions were just, they really were well thought out. They made me think
14:36:19 Hmm.
14:36:15 They kind of brought back, you know, things that I haven't thought about in a while. So I commend you. That was really incredible. I think… I'm just wondering, so I know this is like for the sociological study. Are you guys kind of just using it for…
14:36:26 Understanding the experiences. Is there going to be a final publication of the research?
14:36:36 Oh, very cool. Yeah, yeah.
14:36:32 Yeah, there's gonna be there's gonna, I'm going to publish this is um the equivalent of my master's thesis. And so I'm interviewing. I'll tell you who I'm interviewing.
14:36:44 Oh, very nice. Yeah.
14:36:41 Who like made content about the university in the past 10 years So it's current students and alumni like yourself and I'm trying to understand how people make sense of how college like what are they talking about And then also like how they straddle this identity of being like a, what I'm calling like a higher ed influencer. So someone who
14:37:00 Yeah, yeah.
14:37:01 Tell us about the culture of college, but also someone who is like can receive certain rewards from telling stories in general.
14:37:09 Sure. Yeah. Very cool.
14:37:11 Is anyone that you'd recommend I talk to next? Any other influence?
14:37:14 Yeah. Yeah, I mean, you might already have them on your list. I think a few of the people I said, Jay Towns for sure would be a good one to talk to. Fred Liu.
14:37:23 Would be great, I think, to talk to. He kind of like has a unique experience because he started on TikTok and then he moved to YouTube and started making longer form college videos. He also does lifestyle videos as well, but he's a really great contact as well. I think…
14:37:39 Maybe Ashley Shu 2 is really good too. She was in my ear.
14:37:38 Okay.
14:37:43 Would you recommend, how would you recommend I reach out to these folks? Do you know if any Yeah.
14:37:46 I would probably yeah i would probably do Northwestern email because I still check it. And that's, I think, how I think I saw your email.
14:37:53 And also if it comes from your Northwestern email, which you're obviously still like, I trusted you specifically from the email because I saw the credibility and I'm like, oh, yeah, perfect. Sometimes I got an email and it was like some weird scam and I'm like, what the heck is this? So I think, I think, yeah, if you send it from your Northwestern email and you get theirs from the alumni network, you're chilling. Like I think they'll be way more responsive because sometimes like.
14:38:14 Fred specifically, he has a big following. So it's going to be like he has to cycle through like a lot of those DMs.
14:38:20 Sure. Sure. Sounds good.
14:38:20 Difficult, yeah. Ashley does too. Yeah, if you go, I think if you reach out to all those through email, they should be very responsive.
14:38:30 Got it. Yeah.
14:38:27 That's excellent. Thank you so much. Let me know if any questions come up after this. And yeah, thank you for sharing your story with me. Appreciate it.
14:38:34 No, thanks for having me. It was a pleasure. It was really nice to get in to meet you as well. And feel free to send me that publication when it's done. I'd love to read it.
14:38:41 Yes, definitely. I thoroughly plan to. All right. Take care.
